After months of development since March 21st, we're thrilled to announce TresJS v5! This major release represents a significant evolution of the declarative Three.js framework for Vue, bringing modern architecture, enhanced performance, and cutting-edge WebGPU support.

## üéØ What's New?

Tres 5 is our most ambitious release yet, it's all about making your developer experience better, increasing performance, and future-proofing the framework for the next generation of web graphics in Vue.

- **Start a Tres project quickly**: with the new `create-tres` CLI tool, you can start a new Tres project in seconds.
- **ESM-Only Architecture**: We've made the bold decision to embrace the future by going **ESM-only**.
- **WebGPU Native Support**: The future of web graphics is here! TresJS v5 introduces **experimental WebGPU support**
- **Completly refactor composables**: We've completely refactored our composables system for better reliability and type safety.

### üöÄ New way to start a Tres project

![Tres 5.0 CLI](/blog/tresjs-v5/create-tres.png)

We've created a new CLI tool to help you scaffold a new Tres project with the best practices and the most popular packages.

::code-group
```bash [npm]
npx create-tres my-tres-project
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn create tres my-tres-project
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm create tres my-tres-project
```
::

The CLI provides an **interactive wizard** that guides you through:

::prose-list
- üéØ **Template selection**: Choose between Vue + Vite or Nuxt
- üì¶ **Ecosystem packages**: Select from TresJS ecosystem packages (Cientos, Post-processing, Leches)
- üîß **TypeScript support**: Type safe development with TypeScript
- üìè **ESLint integration**: Code quality with TresJS ESLint config
::

::prose-note
This is the **recommended approach** for new projects as it handles all the configuration automatically and lets you choose exactly what you need.
::


### üåü ESM-Only Architecture

We've made the bold decision to embrace the future by going **ESM-only**. This means:

- **Smaller bundle sizes** with better tree-shaking
- **Faster loading** and improved performance
- **Modern JavaScript standards** alignment
- **Better compatibility** with modern build tools

::prose-warning
**Breaking Change**: UMD builds are no longer supported. If you're using TresJS in a legacy environment, you'll need to update your build pipeline.
::

### ‚ö° WebGPU Native Support 

<UBadge color="primary" variant="soft">Experimental</UBadge>

The future of web graphics is here! TresJS v5 introduces **experimental WebGPU support**, bringing:

- **Next-generation performance** for complex 3D scenes
- **Better GPU utilization** and compute shader support
- **Future-ready architecture** for upcoming web standards
- **Seamless fallback** to WebGL when WebGPU isn't available

```vue [basic-webgpu.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
import { TresCanvas } from '@tresjs/core'
import { WebGPURenderer } from 'three/webgpu'
import type { TresRendererSetupContext } from '@tresjs/core'

// Create WebGPU renderer factory
const createWebGPURenderer = (ctx: TresRendererSetupContext) => {
  const renderer = new WebGPURenderer({
    canvas: toValue(ctx.canvas),
    // WebGPU specific configuration
    alpha: true,
    antialias: true,
  })
  return renderer
}
</script>

<template>
  <TresCanvas :renderer="createWebGPURenderer">
    <TresPerspectiveCamera :position="[3, 3, 3]" />
    <TresBoxGeometry :args="[1, 1, 1]" />
    <TresMeshBasicMaterial color="hotpink" />
    <!-- Your 3D scene here -->
  </TresCanvas>
</template>
```

### üîÑ Enhanced Composables API

We've completely refactored our composables system to become **true Vue composables** (thanks to [Alexander Lichter's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0QrFKBZuqA) üòÖ) with proper reactive state management. The biggest motivation was that many of our previous "composables" weren't actually composables but utility functions wrapping Three.js APIs.

#### Completely Refactored `useLoader`

The `useLoader` composable has been transformed from a simple utility function into a true Vue composable based on `useAsyncData`, providing:

- **Reactive state management** with loading, error, and progress tracking
- **Better Vue integration** with proper composable patterns  
- **Automatic cleanup** and disposal of 3D objects
- **Enhanced TypeScript support** and developer experience
- **Dynamic path loading** - change the model path reactively

```vue
<script setup>
import { GLTFLoader } from 'three/examples/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader'

// ‚ùå Old v4 syntax - returned a promise
// const gltf = await useLoader(GLTFLoader, '/models/duck.gltf')

// ‚úÖ New v5 syntax - returns reactive state object
const { state: model, isLoading, error, progress } = useLoader(
  GLTFLoader, 
  '/models/duck.gltf'
)

// Watch for loading state changes reactively
watch(isLoading, (loading) => {
  if (loading) console.log('Loading model...')
})

// Track loading progress
watch(progress, (prog) => {
  console.log(`Loading: ${prog.percentage}%`)
})
</script>

<template>
  <!-- Reactive loading states in template -->
  <primitive v-if="model" :object="model.scene" />
</template>
```

#### Impact on Cientos Composables

This breaking change also affects Cientos composables like [`useGLTF`](https://deploy-preview-563--cientos-tresjs.netlify.app/guide/loaders/use-gltf.html) and `useFBX`, which now follow the same reactive pattern:

```vue
<script setup>
import { useGLTF } from '@tresjs/cientos'

// ‚úÖ New reactive state pattern in Cientos
const { state, nodes, materials, isLoading, progress } = useGLTF('/model.glb', { 
  draco: true 
})
</script>

<template>
  <primitive v-if="state" :object="state.scene" />
</template>
```

These Cientos composables now provide the same reactive benefits:
- **Reactive loading states** with `isLoading` and `progress`
- **Structured access** to `nodes` and `materials` based on `useGraph` composable 
- **Consistent API** across the TresJS ecosystem

#### Streamlined Event System
- **Renamed events** for clarity:
  - `onAfterRender` ‚Üí `onRender`
  - `onBeforeRender` ‚Üí `onBeforeLoop`
- **Better performance** with optimized event handling
- **More intuitive** API that matches the actual execution flow

### üõ†Ô∏è Developer Experience Improvements

#### Enhanced DevTools
- **Performance metrics tracking** in development
- **Better debugging** with improved error messages
- **Real-time monitoring** of render performance

#### Improved Type Safety
- **Stronger TypeScript integration** across all composables
- **Better IntelliSense** support in your IDE
- **Fewer runtime errors** with compile-time checks

## üíî Breaking Changes & Migration

### Removed Composables
- **`useSeek`**: Deprecated and removed (use native Three.js animation APIs)
- **`useTexture`**: Moved to `@tresjs/cientos` for better organization

### Event Renaming
Update your event handlers:
```vue
<!-- Before (v4) -->
<TresCanvas 
  @after-render="handleAfterRender"
  @before-render="handleBeforeRender"
>

<!-- After (v5) -->
<TresCanvas 
  @render="handleRender"
  @before-loop="handleBeforeLoop"
>
```

### Module Loading
Ensure your bundler supports ESM:
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Works in v5
import { TresCanvas } from '@tresjs/tres'

// ‚ùå No longer supported
const { TresCanvas } = require('@tresjs/tres')
```

## üöÄ Performance Improvements

TresJS v5 brings significant performance enhancements:

- **Optimized render loop** with better frame timing
- **Improved memory management** with smarter resource disposal
- **Faster component initialization** through architectural improvements
- **Better Three.js integration** with updated to v0.177.0

## üåê Ecosystem Updates

With v5, the entire TresJS ecosystem is evolving:

- **@tresjs/cientos** will receive `useTexture` and other utility composables
- **Better modularization** allows you to import only what you need
- **Consistent API** across all TresJS packages

## üîÆ Looking Forward

TresJS v5 sets the foundation for exciting future developments:

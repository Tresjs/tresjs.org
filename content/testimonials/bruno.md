While Three.js makes 3D for the web easier, TresJS makes it effortless and accessible. In just a few lines of code, you can create awesome experiences while maintaining low-level accessibility.

Vue.js is lucky to have such a dedicated and talented community and Iâ€™m always pleased to see new projects made with TresJS.

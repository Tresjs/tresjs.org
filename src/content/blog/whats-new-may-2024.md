Hi everyone! We are back with the latest updates for the TresJS ecosystem. This month we have some exciting news to share with you. Let's dive in!

# Cientos updates 3.9

While in the core the V4 is cooking, in Cientos we aren't resting and so we have exiting news for you.

## Features

### Local canvas option for mouseparallax component

Now we can select the [MouseParallax](https://cientos.tresjs.org/guide/abstractions/mouse-parallax.html) effect so that it is applied for a specific canvas or for the whole viewport.

Made by [emavitta-remago](https://github.com/Tresjs/cientos/commits?author=andretchen0)

### Fit component

[Fit](https://cientos.tresjs.org/guide/staging/fit.html) uniformly scales and positions its children as a group.

Thanks to [andretchen0](https://github.com/Tresjs/cientos/commits?author=andretchen0)

### Positional audio

The [Positional audio](https://cientos.tresjs.org/guide/abstractions/positional-audio.html) is specifically designed for controlling sounds in a scene graph space. This allows us to create a more immersive user experience for the simulation of various audio environments.

### LightFormer

Now you can use [Light Formers](https://cientos.tresjs.org/guide/staging/environment.html#lightformer) in combination with your [Environment](https://cientos.tresjs.org/guide/staging/environment.html) component.

### Holographic Material

Try our new [Holographic Material](https://cientos.tresjs.org/guide/materials/holographic-material.html) (originally developed by [Anderson mancini](https://github.com/ektogamat)) to add holographic effect to your meshes.

With the new [Ocean](https://cientos.tresjs.org/guide/staging/ocean.html) component, it's easier than ever add water to your scenes.

### add mouse/touch props for camera-controls

Two new props arrived for [Camera-Controls](https://cientos.tresjs.org/guide/controls/camera-controls.html). Now we are able to tweak the mouse/touch events.

Yo! We already on March 2024 and the first two months of the year have been quite busy for the TresJS ecosystem. We have been working on a lot of new features and improvements to make your development experience even better. Let's dive into the latest updates on TresJS ecosystem.

## VueJS Amsterdam 2024

We had the opportunity to present a talk at VueJS Amsterdam stage titled **"The Subtle art of 3D Scrolly-telling and Product-Customisation with TresJS"** to show real-world usecases of TresJS. Our goal was to show the audience how easy is to create 3D scenes with Vue, which previously was a intimidating task, now something available for everyone to try 😊.

We even raffle with [Storyblok](https://www.storyblok.com/) a 3D printed version of **Evan You** as a surprise. (Thanks to [Alba Silvente](https://twitter.com/dawntraoz))

We had a blast at VueJS Amsterdam 2024. It was great to meet the community and share our latest updates. We also had the opportunity to meet some of our contributors and users. We are very grateful for the support and feedback we received. We are looking forward to the next edition.


## Playground is now Lab and..

Sandbox is now the actual Playground LOL 😂. I know, naming things can be hard, and we realized that what we used to call `playground.tresjs.org` was actually more like a showcase of what you can achieve with Tres rather than a playground were users could create small scenes, issue reproductions or just try out stuff so thats why now:

- ~~https://playground.tresjs.org/~~ is now --> [https://lab.tresjs.org/](https://lab.tresjs.org/)
- ~~https://sandbox.tresjs.org/~~ is now [https://play.tresjs.org/](https://play.tresjs.org)

Now things make more sense, kinda 😅, sorry about the confusion.

## Cookbook 🍳🧑‍🍳

It's time to cook some recipes with Tres. Following the naming changes, we decided to rename ~~**Examples**~~ into a proper **Cookbook** section.

Each recipe is designed to help you understand the core concepts of Tres and how to use them in your projects.

Checkout the Tres official [Cookbook](https://docs.tresjs.org/cookbook/).

Do you have an specific recipe request in mind? Let us know [here](https://github.com/Tresjs/tres/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.yml)

## Docs are being translated

At the beginning of February we started the task [Translate docs to multiple languages](https://github.com/Tresjs/tres/issues/540) to provide translated documents to all the community. This is huge for us because will enable more and more devs to use Tres by following guides on their native language.

At this very moment we are translating to

- [x] Spanish 🇪🇸
- [x] German 🇩🇪
- [ ] Chinese 🇨🇳
- [ ] French 🇫🇷
- [ ] Polish 🇵🇱
  
If your language is not in the list and you would like to contribute to make it available, let us know in a comment [here](https://github.com/Tresjs/tres/issues/540).


And thats pretty much for this update, hope you are as excited as ourselves.

Happy 3D ✌️.
